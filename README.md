# miniProject
First every time posting something on here.

Hi! This is the first every mini project I did out of panic when
I had 2 exams on the same day. We had to use a calculator 
for one of them just for the basic operators which just 
gave me the idea to make one just because. 
It's pretty a pretty simple c++ implementation, nothing too
hard to understand. Just for fun.
Thank you for checking this out :]

Whats in the file already:

This is a mini project I'm going, literally less than an
hour before back to back exams, just a basic calculator
just an easy implementation, but lowkey, I can use
polymorphism/abstract classes, I will once I finish this ,
ill make a more complicated one

okay running it on CodeBlocks, it becomes an infinite loop
if you accidently click a random letter or maybe symbol,
it just goes into an infinite loop, I will try to fix
it at some other date as simple as possible.

***CALCULATOR ACTIONS***
-Add
-Subtract
-Divide
-Multiply
-Raise to the power
